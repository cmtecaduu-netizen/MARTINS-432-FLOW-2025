# Security Policy - MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025

## 🛡️ Our Commitment
As the MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025 protocol aims for a 99.7% stability rate (The Martins Constant), security is our highest priority. We take the integrity of the harmonic alignment logic and the safety of the systemic flow very seriously.

## ⚠️ Reporting a Vulnerability
To protect the internal logic and the intellectual property of the Architect, **please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a potential security flaw or a breach in the stability framework, please report it privately through the following channels:

* 📧 **Email:** cmte.caduu@gmail.com
* 📱 **WhatsApp:** +55 17 99680-7082

Please include a detailed description of the issue and steps to reproduce it. 

## ⚖️ Non-Disclosure & Professional Ethics
By reporting a vulnerability, you agree to maintain confidentiality regarding the flaw and any internal logic shared during the resolution process. 

Unauthorized disclosure of security vulnerabilities that expose the 432 Hz modulation secrets or the stability engine will be considered a breach of the protocol's license and ethical guidelines.

## 🚀 Resolution Process
1. **Acknowledgement:** You will receive a response within 24-48 hours.
2. **Analysis:** The Architect (Leandro Martins) will personally evaluate the impact on the 99.7% stability margin.
3. **Fix & Credit:** Once resolved, if the contribution is significant, you may be officially credited in the protocol's documentation (unless you prefer anonymity).
