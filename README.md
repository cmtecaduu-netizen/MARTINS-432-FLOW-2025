MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025
​Protocol for Neural Alignment and Harmonic Stability
​This repository documents the MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025 framework, a technical approach to AGI alignment focused on:
​Neural Noise Reduction: Utilizing harmonic resonance (432 Hz) to stabilize large language model outputs.
​Flow Determinism: Ensuring consistency in neural processing pathways for high-scale AI architectures.
​System Stability: Mitigating hallucinations through frequency-based calibration.
​Technical Objectives:
​Reduce stochastic variance in neural weights.
​Implement a harmonic feedback loop for model alignment.
​Establish a public standard for deterministic flow in 2025 AI systems.
​Developed by Leandro Martins.
