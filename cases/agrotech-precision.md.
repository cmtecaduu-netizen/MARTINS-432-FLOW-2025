Case #02: Telemetry Stabilization in Agricultural Aviation
​Protocol: MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025
​1. The Problem
​Drones and agricultural aircraft face high entropy (noise) in GPS and accelerometer data due to mechanical vibration and weather conditions.
​2. The MARTINS-432 Solution
​Implementation of harmonic resonance filtering at 432 Hz to stabilize raw data flow.
​Resonance Factor: 0.432.
​Target Accuracy: Error margin reduced to 0.3%.
​3. Results & Impact
​Efficiency: 15% reduction in pesticide and seed waste.
​Optimization: 10% increase in flight autonomy through smoother trajectory control.
